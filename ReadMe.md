Hey! Thanks for checking out my project.

Tools used:

    - Bootstrap
        Used it's example template list to list out the Notification Rows.
        It helped me with writing less CSS code.
        I'm still famailizaing with responsiveness as bootstarp is pre-equiped with it but I guess it just dosen't look right to me?.

    -jQuery
        I used jQuery to make the norification read/unread (Double-click).
        Update notification on real-time.
        And I used functions for all this except for mark all as read.
        I couldn't find an more concise way to do that.
        I refered the documentation and became more familar with this framework.

    -HTML
        As usual I tried to followed the standards of HTML5 and did my best.

    -Github
        As where your reading from you're already aware I hosted it on Github free hosting service.
